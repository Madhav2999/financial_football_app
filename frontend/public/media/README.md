# Quiz background video

Place your looping quiz background video in this folder and name it `quiz-background.mp4`.

The React app references `/media/quiz-background.mp4` for the ambient playback. You can replace the placeholder file name with your own video without changing any code. Ensure the video is optimized for web delivery (muted, short loop, reasonable resolution) so it loads quickly during matches.
